                        <p>Liberal arts is a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to learning that emphasizes a broad-based curriculum, critical thinking, and the development of well-rounded individuals.</p>
                        <p>The concept has roots dating back to classical civilizations of Grece and Rome. This aproach to education was aimed at producing informed and responsible citizens who could engage in public life. During the middle ages, the tradition of liberal arts was preserved and promoted through the monastic and cathedral schools of europe. The curriculum included trivium(grammar, rhetoric and logic) and the quadvirum(arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy), which forms the basis of a classical education.</p>
                        <p>We provide a curriculum that combines the humanities, sciences, and social sciences.</p>
